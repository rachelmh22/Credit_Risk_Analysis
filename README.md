# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to execute a variety of machine learning models to assess whether individuals have low or high credit risks. The machine learning modules implemented include oversampling and undersampling the data, as we as a combination approach. In addition, two other machine learning models used include BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 

## Results: bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores 

### Random Oversampling

### SMOTE Oversampling

### Undersampling

### Combination Sampling (SMOTEENN)

### Balanced Random Forest Classifier

### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
